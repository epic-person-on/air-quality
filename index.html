<p>Never have I thought that humans were</p>
<p> gonna intentionally destroy nature. Humans literally burn down forests for war and now humans must</p>
<p>give back to nature.</p>
<p>You, your own species decimating forests for war. Imagine you woke up to humans burning your home</p>
<p>up. Imagine you were a animal who was forced to leave your home and</p>
<p>never come back because humans wanted to argue with violence. Why humans</p>
<p>gonna go around and destroy the environment for there own selfish needs. Humans have</p>
<p>Let us down. Now</p>
<p>You need to help bring us back up from</p>
<p>Down here back to a nature loving race that lives in harmony with animals.</p>
